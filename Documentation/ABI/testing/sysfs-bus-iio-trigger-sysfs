Description:
		This file is provided by the iio-trig-sysfs stand-alone trigger
		driver. Writing this file with any value triggers an event
		driven driver, associated with this trigger, to capture data
		into an in kernel buffer. This approach can be valuable during
		automated testing or in situations, where other trigger methods
		are not applicable. For example no RTC or spare GPIOs.
		X is the IIO index of the trigger.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/triggerX/name
KernelVersion:	2.6.39
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		The name attribute holds a description string for the current
		trigger. In order to associate the trigger with an IIO device
		one should write this name string to
		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceY/trigger/current_trigger.
