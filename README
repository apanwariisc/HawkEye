The implementation of HawkEye, our research system:
"HawkEye: Efficient Fine-grained OS Support for Huge Pages"
published in Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS) 2019.


This kernel relies on a user-space tool to periodically update the TLB miss processing overhead (aka MMU overhead) of running processes. A special purpose system call "update_mm_ohp_stats" is provided for the user-space to update this. The MMU overhead can be easily calculated on x86 with hardware performance counters using tools like perf. A sample tool that was used in our design is hosted as the following

More details on using the HawkEye system will be updated shortly.
